## Storage
We use PlayFab to store our user data and synchronizing them on the fly.

## Server-side
There are various functions that will be executed on our server (Cloudscript PlayFab and Azure Functions) to prevent untrusted clients (cheating...).

## Optimization
Lightmap baking and atlas texture are used to reduce as much draw calls as possible.
